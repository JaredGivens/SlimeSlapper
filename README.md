# FPSController
The goal of this controller was to mimic how Valves character controller feels in their games, the reference I used was Team Fortress 2.

Bellow are the listed notable features:

## PlayerController:
- Smooth crouching
- Can walk up and down hills smoothly
- If a slope is too steep the controller will slide down
- Double jumping can be increased to any number when enabled
- Can be affected by forces, Ex: Explosion force, Jump Pads, etc.
- *Incomplete* Can move up and down objects tagged as ladders

## Player Camera
- Aim punch
- Camera wobble

### Future Goals
- Network when Unity releases thei new network API
- Finish LadderMovement
- Add Swimming
